# The courses data are stored in the final.csv file.

As of today, 5/2/2024, there are exactly 2495 courses. I have checked up to ID 5000, so there may be more.

Of course, more courses will be added beyond this date, but I won't update this CSV file until I find a purpose to use this data.

Note that the elective field for all courses is set to false. I'm not entirely sure why, but that's how it is stored in their database.

Feel free to use the data in any way you want.
